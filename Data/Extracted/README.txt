This folder contains .dta files generated from raw HRS data, including both direct
extractions (using the HRS-provided dictionary files) and files constructed by merging
across these files.  This folder should be empty in the public archive, but all files
can be constructed by putting the appropriate raw HRS files into ../RawHRS and running
../ConstructData.do.

TODO: Write list of raw HRS files to put in ../RawHRS
